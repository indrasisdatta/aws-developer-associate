     Must not exceed 512 MB

3. A developer is updating an Amazon ECS app that uses an ALB with two target groups and a single listener. The developer has an AppSpec file in an S3 bucket and an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group tied to the ALB and AppSpec file. The developer needs to use an AWS Lambda function for update validation before deployment. Which solution meets these requirements?
Ans: Add a listener to the ALB. Update the AppSpec file to link the Lambda function to the BeforeAllowTraffic lifecycle hook

The AppSpec file allows a developer to specify scripts to be run at different lifecycle hooks. The BeforeAllowTraffic lifecycle event occurs before the updated task set is moved to the target group that is receiving live traffic. So, any validation before production deployment should be configured at this lifecycle event. The listener is configured at the ALB level, not at the deployment group.

4. A Developer is designing a fault-tolerant application that will use Amazon EC2 instances and an Elastic Load Balancer. The Developer needs to ensure that if an EC2 instance fails session data is not lost. How can this be achieved?
