     Must not exceed 512 MB

3. A developer is updating an Amazon ECS app that uses an ALB with two target groups and a single listener. The developer has an AppSpec file in an S3 bucket and an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group tied to the ALB and AppSpec file. The developer needs to use an AWS Lambda function for update validation before deployment. Which solution meets these requirements?
Ans: Add a listener to the ALB. Update the AppSpec file to link the Lambda function to the BeforeAllowTraffic lifecycle hook

The AppSpec file allows a developer to specify scripts to be run at different lifecycle hooks. The BeforeAllowTraffic lifecycle event occurs before the updated task set is moved to the target group that is receiving live traffic. So, any validation before production deployment should be configured at this lifecycle event. The listener is configured at the ALB level, not at the deployment group.

4. A Developer is designing a fault-tolerant application that will use Amazon EC2 instances and an Elastic Load Balancer. The Developer needs to ensure that if an EC2 instance fails session data is not lost. How can this be achieved?

7. A developer is using AWS CodeBuild to build an application into a Docker image. The buildspec file is used to run the application build. The developer needs to push the Docker image to an Amazon ECR repository only upon the successful completion of each build.
Ans: Add a post_build phase to the buildspec file that uses the commands block to push the Docker image

8. An organization handles data that requires high availability in its relational database. The main headquarters for the organization is in Virginia with smaller offices located in California. The main headquarters uses the data more frequently than the smaller offices. How should the developer configure their databases to meet high availability standards?
Ans: Create an Aurora database with the primary database in Virginia and specify the failover to the Aurora replica in another AZ in Virginia

9. A developer is responsible for a business critical application that uses Amazon DynamoDB as its main data repository.

It then computes a cumulative average of the numerical data within the messages. After the initial Lambda function tests, the programmer discovered the computed cumulative average was not consistent. What should the programmer do to ascertain the accuracy of the cumulative average computed by the function?
Ans: Set the provisioned concurrency of the function to 1. Compute the cumulative average within the function. Retain the computed cumulative average in Amazon ElastiCache
(Setting the provisioned concurrency of the function to 1 ensures that only one instance of the function will be operating at any given time)

What code updates will grant these new users’ access to the API?
     Ans: The createUsagePlanKey method must be called to associate the newly created API key with the correct usage plan

10. An AWS Lambda function is being developed in a VPC. When a file is added to an Amazon S3 bucket, this Lambda function is triggered, processes the file, and logs the results into a file. These result and log files need to be accessible by other AWS services and on-premises resources.
