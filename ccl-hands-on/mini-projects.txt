Mini-project ideas

1) Static Website Hosting: 
Use Amazon S3 to host a static website. Upload HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to an S3 bucket, and configure it for static website hosting.
[Done]

2) Dynamic Website with EC2: 
Deploy a simple dynamic website using Amazon EC2. Install a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx), host a basic application, and configure security groups.

3) Serverless Web Application: 
Build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. Create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

4) File Storage and Sharing: 
Use Amazon S3 to create a file-sharing system. Allow users to upload and download files securely. Explore S3 features like versioning, bucket policies, and access control.

5) Database Setup with RDS: 
Set up a relational database using Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service). Create a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, connect to it from an EC2 instance, and perform basic operations.

6) Message Queues with SQS: 
Implement a basic messaging system using Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS). Create a queue, send and receive messages between different components of your application.

7) Authentication and Authorization: 
Use Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization. Create a simple application that requires user login and demonstrates secure access to AWS resources.

8) Content Delivery Network (CDN) with CloudFront:
Set up Amazon CloudFront to accelerate the delivery of your static and dynamic web content. Integrate it with your S3 bucket or an EC2 instance.

9) Serverless Image Processing:
Use AWS Lambda to create a serverless image processing function. For example, you can resize or watermark images uploaded to an S3 bucket.

10) Monitoring and Logging with CloudWatch:
Set up monitoring for your AWS resources using Amazon CloudWatch. Create alarms, monitor EC2 instances, and configure logging for your applications.
